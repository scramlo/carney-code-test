# CSS Test for Carney

## Overview

Build this project grid component (from the Landify UI Kit) and try to match the design as closely as possible.

## Specs

- [x] Deliver a plain HTML file if you want, or feel free to use CodePen or a similar site.

- [ ] Use vanilla CSS, SCSS, LESS, or whatever you want.

- [ ] Use Inter font, available on Google Fonts.

- [ ] Each project block should be a link.

- [ ] When you hover/focus a project, the other ones should fade out (50% opacity) and the image should become grayscale.

- [ ] Projects should become square and stack when the screen is less than `992px` wide.

- [ ] No javascript.

## Developer Comments

1. I broke up the SCSS in a way which would make sense for an entire application / website, not just one component. This was purposeful to show my ability to think in terms of scale.
